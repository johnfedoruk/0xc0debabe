# 0xc0debabe

## Another JavaScript Framework..
Yes. 0xc0debabe makes use of Angular JS, and other flexible frameworks and libraries to create a structured application for rapid development. It's intended to be more of a framework than most JavaScript frameworks. It includes build tools to further help speed up the development process.

## But what's with the name?
It's hexspeak. Ask any OS hacker or hard core C/assembly kid. You can pronounce 0xc0debabe as *Hex Code Babe*. Weird, eh?!

## Open source?
Sure. It's built on the MIT license, so go nuts.
